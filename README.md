### <span style="color: Yellow"> Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

# Setting up Visual Studio Code

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

# Setting up MySQL 8.0

1. Download and install [MySQL 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
2. Configure your database by following the setup instructions, creating necessary tables and entries for Pok√©mon data.

# Setting up Node Js
1. Download and install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Open Windows Powershell as admin
3. Enter the command (Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned)
4. Once the prompt to change the execution policy appears Type (A) Yes to all, then Enter.

#### Step 1: Create Your Database

> **Note:** For testing purposes, it's recommended to create a new database.

Run the following commands in your MySQL interface:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE pokemon_app;
USE pokemon_app;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE pokemon (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(50),
    level INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

#### Step 2: Generate a JWT Secret Key

1. Create a new `.js` file (e.g., `generateKey.js`).
2. Add the following code to generate a secret key:

   ```javascript
   const crypto = require('crypto');
   const jwtSecret = crypto.randomBytes(64).toString('hex');
   console.log(jwtSecret);
   ```
3. Run the file using Node.js:

   ```
   node "placeholdername.js"
   ```



#### Step 4: Update Your Credentials in `app.js`

Edit the `app.js` file to replace placeholders with your own credentials, such as your MySQL password, JWT secret key, and database name (if you're using a test database). Don't forget this is just the snippet.

Here is an example `app.js`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const mysql = require('mysql');
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const cors = require('cors'); // Import cors

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.use(cors());

const db = mysql.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'root',
    password: 'YOUR_PASSWORD', // Replace with your MySQL password
    database: 'pokemon_app'// (Replace this if you are testing)
});

db.connect(err => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Connected to MySQL');
});

// Replace this with your generated JWT secret key
const jwtSecret = 'YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY';
```
#### Step 5: Run the Application

To start the application, type:

```
node app.js
```

Then, run it on your live server.

Troubleshooting
If you experience issues with MySQL, run the following commands in your MySQL query interface:

```SQL
ALTER USER 'your_username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
```kotlin
Replace 'your_username' and 'your_password' with your MySQL username and password.
```
